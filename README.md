**An Amazon-like storefront utilizing a MySQL database**

Bamazon is an Amazon-like storefront with a MySQL database that stores product information. The app will take in orders from customers via the command line, and update stock accordingly from the store's inventory. 

The app also tracks product sales across each department and then provides a summary of the highest-grossing departments in the store.

## Get Started
